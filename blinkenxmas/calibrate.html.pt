    <p>Please select the current "angle" of the tree. This is a relative
    measure. You should start by calibrating "angle zero", i.e. the natural
    position of your tree. Then rotate your tree by a measured amount about its
    trunk and calibrate the new angle.</p>
    <p>You will likely need 4 or 5 calibration measurements to accurately plot
    the position of all LEDs on your tree. Remember that not all LEDs will be
    visible from each position and the algorithm requires at least two
    different views of each LED to calculate its 3-dimensional position. It may
    help to mark "angle zero" on the floor by the tree so that you can measure
    (or at least estimate to the nearest 10 degrees) the rotation of the tree
    for each calibration.</p>
