    <p>The angle is a relative measure. You should start by calibrating "angle
    zero", i.e. the "normal" position of your tree. Once calibration of this
    angle is complete, rotate your tree by a measured amount about the axis
    running through its trunk and calibrate the new angle.</p>

    <p>You will likely need 4 or 5 scans of different angles to accurately plot
    the position of all LEDs on your tree. Remember that not all LEDs will be
    visible from each position and the algorithm requires at least two
    different views of each LED to calculate its 3-dimensional position. It may
    help to mark "angle zero" on the floor by the tree so that you can measure
    (or at least estimate to the nearest 10 degrees) the rotation of the tree
    for each calibration.</p>
