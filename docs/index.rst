Welcome to Blinken' Xmas! A project to display a tasteful assortment of
positively festive animations across strings of neopixels adorning your
Christmas tree. Or a project to blast screaming rainbows into the eyeballs of
your nearest and dearest. I take no responsibility for your choices.

    :alt: The 250 neopixies of the Asda 6ft Green Christmas Tree display a
          tasteful rainbow over the height of the tree.

The :doc:`tutorial` is probably the best place to start as it'll walk you
through all the hardware configuration, and software installation. If you want
to hack on the project, it's pretty easy to add animations; see the
:doc:`development` chapter on getting started.

.. warning::

    The documentation is still very incomplete...
