This tutorial will guide you through setting up Blinken' Xmas on your Christmas
tree, with multiple strands of neopixels attached to the Pico, and a Raspberry
Pi with a camera module for the server to perform calibration on the positions.

.. note::

    Please be aware this is *not* a quick set up you are likely to finish in an
    afternoon. However, once the hardware side is put together, setting things
    in future years can indeed be accomplished quite quickly (in about an hour,
    from experience).
